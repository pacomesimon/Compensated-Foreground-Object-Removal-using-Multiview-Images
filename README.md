# Project: Compensated Foreground Object Removal using Multiview Images

## Overview
This project involves the management and processing of image data for the `Compensated Foreground Object Removal using Multiview Images` project. It includes the creation of necessary directories for storing original images, inference data, model outputs, and stitched images.

## Setup
To set up the project, run the `migrate.py` script. This script will ensure that all necessary directories are created.

## Directory Structure
The project automatically creates the following directories if they do not exist:
- `DATA/original_images`: Stores the original images.
- `INFERENCE_DATA`: Used to store data needed for inference.
- `LABELS/masks_imgs`: Contains mask images generated by the model.
- `LABELS/model_outputs`: Stores outputs from the model.
- `MODEL_CHECKPOINTS`: Used to store model checkpoints during training.
- `STITCHED_IMAGES`: Stores images that are stitched together post-processing.

## Configuration
The paths for these directories are configured in `config.py`. Ensure that this file is updated if there are any changes to the directory paths.

## Usage
After setting up the directory structure, you can proceed with placing your original images in the `DATA/original_images` directory and running your model training and inference scripts as per your project requirements.

Contributors are welcome to improve the project by submitting pull requests or opening issues for bugs and feature requests.
