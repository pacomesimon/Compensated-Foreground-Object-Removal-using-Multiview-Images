# Project: Compensated Foreground Object Removal using Multiview Images

## Overview
This project involves the management and processing of image data for the `Compensated Foreground Object Removal using Multiview Images` project. It includes the creation of necessary directories for storing original images, inference data, model outputs, and stitched images.

## Setup
To set up the project, run the `migrate.py` script. This script will ensure that all necessary directories are created.

## Directory Structure
The project automatically creates the following directories if they do not exist:
- `DATA/original_images`: Stores the original images.
- `INFERENCE_DATA`: Used to store data needed for inference.
- `LABELS/masks_imgs`: Contains mask images generated by the model.
- `LABELS/model_outputs`: Stores outputs from the model.
- `MODEL_CHECKPOINTS`: Used to store model checkpoints during training.
- `STITCHED_IMAGES`: Stores images that are stitched together post-processing.

## Configuration
The paths for these directories are configured in `config.py`. Ensure that this file is updated if there are any changes to the directory paths.

## Usage
After setting up the directory structure, you can proceed with placing your original images in the `DATA/original_images` directory and running your model training and inference scripts as per your project requirements.
### Here are the key steps:
1. Image Segmentation: go to `segmentation.ipynb` and run the codes to get segmentation masks
2. Perspective Projection: go to `perspective_projection.ipynb` and run the codes to infill the segmented parts with content from other views.
3. Image Regeneration: go to `regeneration.ipynb` and run the codes to inpaint the images, using a deep learning model
4. Finalize: go to `finalizing_images.ipynb` and run the codes to upsample the inpainted holes and put them back to the original images.
